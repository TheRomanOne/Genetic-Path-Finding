# Genetic-Path-Finding
Path finding between two points on a map with obstacles, using a genetic algorithm.

Double click "mainActivity.py" to launch the program

The first window shows a grid of cells with two points, A and B.

At first a random path will begin to build up

Finally the acyclic path will be chosen, and then an entire population paths will be generated in the background.

Evolution kicks in, in search of the shortest path

With the shortest path detected getting smaller with every generation

Until there are no more changes in the shortest length

This graph shows the shortest path length as a function of generations
